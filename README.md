# Database-Project
This project is realized by me and Zakaria Boulkhir as a database course project in the Master 1 of data science at the university of Lille.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to implement an algorithm to import an __XML__ document into an __SQL__ relational database, and translating the largest possible fragment of __XPath__ to equivalent __SQL__ queries using Python.

The main steps of this project are:

- Proposing a relational encoding scheme for a given __XML__ document.

- Implementation of the functionality of importing an __XML__ document `imdb.xml` into a relational database using __SAX API__.
  
- Developing of a scheme of translating largest possible fragment of __XPath__ to equivalent __SQL__ queries evaluated over the encoded instance.
  
- Proposing an automated testing approach to verify that the system is working correctly.
  
- Developing a protocol for experimental comparison of the querying (time) performance of the system and an existing __XML__ query system.
