Project : Building and XML database

  1. propose an relational encoding scheme for a given XML document.

  2. implement the functionality of importing an XML document imdb.xml into a relational database using SAX API.
  
  3. develop a scheme of translating largest possible fragment of XPath to equivalent SQL queries evaluated over the encoded instance.
  
  4. propose an automated testing approach to verify that your system is working correctly.
  
  5. develop a protocol for experimental comparison of the querying (time) performance of your system and an existing XML query system.
